## Mutambuze’s Bible Study Bot

The bot is a bible study technological innovation that streams multiple versions of the bible over chat through messaging platforms like Telegram. 

### Features

1. Send a verse and receive back a message containing the verse along with support buttons to enable you to change the bible versions. 

2. Send words you remember from scripture e.g. “for God so loved the world” and receive back a browsable list of verses containing those words. The search service allows you to dive deeper into a specific verse by pressing the “Read” button and returning to the search results by pressing the “Back” button.

3. The smart pagination makes it easy to navigate the bible with limited scrolling by using the “Prev” and “Next” buttons.

4. The verse snap tool allows you to generate a photo of any verse - by simply pressing the camera button - that you can share with friends and family over social media.

5. The audio bible support allows you to listen to the bible in both English (KJV) and Luganda at any time by simply pressing the sound buttons.

6. The verse mixer service makes it possible to read a verse in two bible versions at the same time by simply pressing the “Mix” button. At the moment, only KJV and the Luganda bible are supported.
